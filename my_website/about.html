    <p>Hello!
      <br>I'm looking forward to having a very eventful senior year.
      <br>A little more about me: I am a very open person who enjoys other people's company. My goal in life is to inspire people.
      <br>I love helping others, as cheesy as that sounds. I just tend to find happiness in other people's happiness.
      <br>In my free time, I enjoy going out on walks and observing nature. However, I don't do this much since I often have work.
      <br>My favorite thing about school is the fact that I get to meet so many different people and learn more about them.
      <br>The way I think of it, the more people you get to know, the higher chance you have of meeting multiple friends that will last a lifetime.
    </p>
