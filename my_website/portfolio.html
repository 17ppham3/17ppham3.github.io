    <p>The purpose of my game is to essentially gain as many points as you possibly can, all the while avoiding touching
    <br>the perimeters and the snake's own tail. The incremental process was that the tail continued to keep grow as
    <br>the game continued. Also, a pepe head pops up after a you reach 5 points. The hardest part of this was getting
    <br>the game to work in the first place. With Ms. Terry's aid, my partner and I were able to get the game working.</p>
