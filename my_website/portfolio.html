    <p>The purpose of my game is to essentially gain as many points as you possibly can, all the while avoiding touching
    <br>the perimeters and the snake's own tail. The incremental process was that the tail continued to keep grow as
    <br>the game continued. Also, a pepe head pops up after a you reach 5 points. The hardest part of this was getting
    <br>the game to work in the first place. With Ms. Terry's aid, my partner and I were able to get the game working.</p>

    <p>In this game, you are an apprentice of a great cleric in your local village that is known to be able to heal any illness.
    <br>You venture on a journey of discovery to find out how your story ends with this cleric. In order to know how to correctly
    <br>program my game, you must know how to create multiple different functions on the coding language of Python. This was because the
    <br>story depended on a raw input of the user, which led to the different outcomes. The problem that I came across was figuring out
    <br>how to get the story to go back in a loop, since some answers led to the same outcomes. However, I was able to figure it out by
    <br>initiating a function when a certain choice was inputted. I really enjoyed creating the fictional world, but the coding was 
    <br>sometimes confusing after staring at a screen for so long. I liked Happy Timmy because it was ironic and Baking with Mama because I 
    <br>did not expect to turn out to be a dog. If I could, I would try to make my story a bit less dark *ahem, Henry*.</p>
